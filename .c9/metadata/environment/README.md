Testing\nIn the process of developing this project, Chrome Development Tool was used to assess responsiveness as well as designing and debugging.  HTML validator was used to validate the codes.\n\nBrowsers tested were Safari and Google Chrome.\n\nThe website also tested with my iPhone SE and MacAir.\n\n##### **Manual testings:**\n**Navbar** - clicking on all pages to ensure they are all properly linked to the right page.  I also reduced to smaller device screen to test for ability to toggle.

If required field not filled, error message will come out to ask to fill the field. When form is filled and click on 'send', the button changes color and to 'sent'.\n\n### G. Deployment\nAs introduced by Code Institute, I have used *Cloud9 IDE* through AWS website which supports [Github](https://github.com/) and Git repositories as the main platform to develop my website.\n\nCodes developed in Cloud 9 IDE were committed to Git with a repository created in Github beforehand. \n\nThen I pushed them to Github through in-built function of Cloud 9 IDE.\n\nThen I signed into Github account and clicked on the **repository** with the name **‘Capel82/back2nature’**\n\nThis showed the files, images, readme and assets.  \n\nI then go the settings of Github account page, scroll to Github Page and select Source as 'Master Branch' and Theme Choose as \"Cayman\". My site is then published as displayed by the link which i can click on to deploy.\n\n### H.Credits\n\na. **Contents:** The contents about Langkawi information were taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langkawi) websites.
